This is a flask-ask app designed to be used with alexa.
You will need to create an alexa app on the aws platform and upload the interaction_model.json file which describes the intents that the app accepts.
You will need to set and endpoint on the alexa platform to match the endpoint to match the deployment location of this code.
For debugging, you can tunnel traffic to your local machine via something like ngrok.
