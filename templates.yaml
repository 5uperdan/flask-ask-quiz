facts: 'While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Python’s creator named the language in honour of the TV show.
One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception. There are not many languages whose authors are known by name.
Python was created by Guido van Rossum, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Of course, van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself.
Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:
·         an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
·         open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
·         code that is as understandable as plain English;
·         suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.
Let us look at Python functions. There are a number of functions in Python which have different effects and results in the program. Let’s look at the Print function. It is used to display the program output as arguments. However, when there are no arguments i.e. an empty print function, it creates a new line.
So when you run a Python program and get results or outputs, how do you store them for later use? Python will help you with that. It offers special “boxes” (containers) for that purpose, and these boxes are called variables – the name itself suggests that the content of these containers can be varied in (almost) any way. So every Python variable have two things in common:
·         a name;
·         a value (the content of the container)
Let’s start with the issues related to a variable’s name. Variables do not appear in a program automatically. As developer, you must decide how many and which variables to use in your programs. You must also name them.  If you want to give a name to a variable, you must follow some strict rules. We will discuss tis in detail at a later course.
Thank you for competing this part of the course.'
